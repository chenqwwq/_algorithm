/**
 * 526. Beautiful Arrangement
 * Suppose you have n integers labeled 1 through n. A permutation of those n integers perm (1-indexed) is considered a beautiful arrangement if for every i (1 <= i <= n), either of the following is true:
 * <p>
 * perm[i] is divisible by i.
 * i is divisible by perm[i].
 * Given an integer n, return the number of the beautiful arrangements that you can construct.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: n = 2
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation:
 * The first beautiful arrangement is [1,2]:
 * - perm[1] = 1 is divisible by i = 1
 * - perm[2] = 2 is divisible by i = 2
 * The second beautiful arrangement is [2,1]:
 * - perm[1] = 2 is divisible by i = 1
 * - i = 2 is divisible by perm[2] = 1
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: n = 1
 * Output: 1
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * 1 <= n <= 15
