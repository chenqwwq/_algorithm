/**
 * 137. Single Number II
 * Given an integer array nums where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: nums = [2,2,3,2]
 * Output: 3
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
 * Output: 99
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
 * -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
 * Each element in nums appears exactly three times except for one element which appears once.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Follow up: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?
